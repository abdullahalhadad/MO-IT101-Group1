## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: The system displays "Error loading data" at startup.
**Solution**: Check your internet connection. The system needs to access CSV files stored online.

**Issue**: Incorrect date format error.
**Solution**: Always enter dates in MM/DD/YYYY format (e.g., 03/15/2025).

**Issue**: Employee not found when searching.
**Solution**: Ensure you're entering the correct employee number or name. Search is case-insensitive.

**Issue**: Zero or incorrect hourly rate shown.
**Solution**: The system has fallback mechanisms to determine hourly rates. If the direct rate is unavailable, it calculates based on the employee's basic salary or position.

**Issue**: Attendance records not showing.
**Solution**: Verify that the employee has attendance records for the specified date range.

### How Calculations Are Performed

1. **Hours Worked**: Calculated as the duration between clock-in and clock-out times.
2. **Gross Pay**: Hours worked Ã— Hourly rate.
3. **Net Pay**: Gross pay minus deductions:
   - SSS contribution (based on a contribution table)
   - PhilHealth contribution (3% of monthly basic salary, divided by 2)
   - Pag-IBIG contribution (2% of monthly basic salary)
   - Withholding tax (based on Philippine tax brackets)

### Data Security

All data is processed locally on your machine. The system fetches data from secured online sources but does not transmit any processed information back to external servers.
